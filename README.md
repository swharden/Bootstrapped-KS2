# Bootstrapped KS2 Tester

The ***Bootstrapped KS2 Tester*** is a standalone program which makes it easy to perform the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test on two-samples. It also has tools to bootstrap this test (repeating it many times on random sub-samples of the original data). See the [theory](/theory/) page for implementation details.
